I am now a senior undergraduate majoring in [Naval Architecture And Ocean Engineering](https://hanghai.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/), Xi'an, China. I am now an intern in the team of Professor [Peng DU](https://penguinfluid.wordpress.com/about-me/) at the ["Underwater Bionics and Flow Control" Technology Innovation Team of Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://hanghai.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1600/8628.htm), mainly researching hydrodynamic characteristics of underwater vehicle, numerical simulation

My research interests are fluid mechanics, New power propulsion system.
